# Angular14: Testing Stand Alone Components

> Angular 14 introduces an alternative way to write applications — Standalone components, directives, and pipes.

> The term “standalone” refers to components, directives, or pipes that can be used independently of NgModule.

> With standalone components, directives and pipes, the `standalone: true` flag allows you to add imports directly in your @Component() without an @NgModule().

---

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


```js
ng serve -o --poll=2000
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
